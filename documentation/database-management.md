# Advanced database commands

Here we describe some additional useful commands to handle IYP dumps.

## Update existing database

If you [setup the database](../README.md#set-up-iyp) you can load a new dump without
recreating the Docker containers. Place the new dump at `dumps/neo4j.dump`, delete the
existing database and run only the loader again:

```bash
# If the database is running, stop it.
# docker stop iyp
# Delete the existing database
rm -r data/*
# Run the loader
docker start -i iyp_loader
# Start the database.
docker start iyp
```

## Save modified database

If you did changes to the database and want to dump the contents into a file, you can
use the loader for this. For example, to dump the database into a folder called
`backups`:

```bash
# Directory has to exist or it will be created as root by Docker.
mkdir -p backups
uid="$(id -u)" gid="$(id -g)" docker compose run --rm -i -v "$PWD/backups:/backups" iyp_loader neo4j-admin database dump neo4j --to-path=/backups --verbose --overwrite-destination
```

This will create a file called `neo4j.dump` in the `backups` folder. **Note that this
will also overwrite this file if it exists!**

## View Neo4j logs

To view the logs of the Neo4j container, use the following command:

```bash
docker logs -f iyp
```

## Create a new dump from scratch

**Enabling all crawlers will download a lot of data and take multiple days to create a
dump.**

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InternetHealthReport/internet-yellow-pages.git
cd internet-yellow-pages
```

Create Python environment and install Python libraries:

```bash
python3 -m venv --upgrade-deps .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a configuration file from the example file and add API keys. **Note that some
crawlers do not work without credentials.**

```bash
cp config.json.example config.json
# Edit as needed
```

Create and populate a new database:

```bash
python3 create_db.py
```
