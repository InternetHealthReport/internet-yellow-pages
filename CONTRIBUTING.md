## Step 4: Setup pre-commit
pre-commit install

## Step 5: Create and Publish Working Branch
git checkout -b <type>/<issue|issue-number>/{<additional-fixes>}
git push origin <type>/<issue|issue-number>/{<additional-fixes>}

## Types:
# wip - Work in Progress; long term work; mainstream changes;
# feat - New Feature; future planned; non-mainstream changes;
# bug - Bug Fixes
# exp - Experimental; random experimental features;
```

### On Task Completion

```bash
## Commit and Push Your Work
# Check branch
git branch
# Fetch and merge with upstream/main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
# Add untracked files
git add .
# Commit all changes with appropriate commit message and description
git commit -m "your-commit-message" -m "your-commit-description"
# Fetch and merge with upstream/main again
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
# Push changes to your forked repository
git push origin <type>/<issue|issue-number>/{<additional-fixes>}
```

Create the PR using GitHub Website.

Create a pull request from `<type>/<issue|issue-number>/{<additional-fixes>}` branch in your forked
repository to the main branch in the upstream repository.

After creating the PR, add a reviewer (any admin) and yourself as the assignee. Link the PR to
appropriate issue, or Project+Milestone (if no issue was created).

### After PR Merge

```bash
# Delete branch from forked repo
git branch -d <type>/<issue|issue-number>/{<additional-fixes>}
git push --delete origin <type>/<issue|issue-number>/{<additional-fixes>}
# Fetch and merge with upstream/main
git checkout main
git pull upstream
git push origin
```
