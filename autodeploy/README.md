# Autodeployment Script

## Usage

### Starting caddy

Make sure that Caddy is running. If not, run it with `docker compose up caddy`. If Caddy
was running previously, then the new Caddy instance will resume from the previous
config. See the [Caddy docs](https://caddyserver.com/docs/running#docker-compose) for
more info.

### Running the script

To run the script, run `python3 -m autodeploy.autodeploy <config>`. This will first find the date
of the most recent active deployment using the caddy config. If there is no active
deployment, today's date is used. With this date, the script will then check ihr-archive
to see if a dump has been pushed in the subsequent 7 days. If so, a neo4j instance will
be deployed using that dump. For example, if the latest deployment is for 2024-06-15,
the script will check if there is a dump for 2024-06-16 to 2024-06-23.

Alternatively, running `python3 -m autodeploy.autodeploy <config> --date [year]-[month]-[day]` will
check if there is a dump in the archive for the specified date and deploy it directly.

## How it works

### Checking for a dump to deploy

If the date is not provided when running the script, it will first make a request to
Caddy to get the current config. The config is parsed to retrieve the port of the active
database. The date is parsed from the port number as explained below. Starting from this
date, the next 7 days are then checked in ihr-archive for valid dumps.

#### Caddy Config

Caddy is updated by substituting the desired ports in the specified Caddy config
template. The ports are constructed with the following structure: 1MMDD for neo4j http
port, and 2MMDD for neo4j bolt port. The json is sent to caddy by making a POST request
to sandbox.ihr.live:2019/load.  The current config is retrieved by making a GET request
to sandbox.ihr.live:2019/config.

### Starting the database

Once a dump has been found, its log is downloaded from the archive. If the log indicates
that there are no errors, then the dump is downloaded. A docker container is then
started that loads the dump into a neo4j database. The database is stored in a docker
volume with the name data-MM-DD. Another container is then used to start the database
using the data stored in data-MM-YY. It binds its internal neo4j 7474 and 7687 ports to
the external ones that contain the dump's date.

If a container is already running for this date, it and its data volume are deleted, and
a new one is created from the downloaded dump data.

If there was already an active database, it becomes the previous database. The current
previous database container is stopped, and its data volume is deleted.
