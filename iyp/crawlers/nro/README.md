# Number Resource Organization -- https://www.nro.net/

The Number Resource Organization (NRO) is the coordinating body for the worldâ€™s Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs). The RIRs manage the distribution of Internet number resources (IP address space
and Autonomous System Numbers) within their respective regions.

As part of a joint RIR project to provide consistent and accessible Internet number resource
statistics the NRO publishes [*Extended Allocation and Assignment
Reports*](https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/statistics/) (also called *delegated stats*) that contain
information about assigned IP address ranges and AS numbers.

Each line of the report is a record that either represents an IP address range or an AS number. The
record has a status and maps to an *opaque ID* that uniquely identifies a single organization.
Finally, the record contains a country code to which the organization belongs.

**Note:** If the record is not assigned, the country code is `ZZ`, which will still be inserted into
IYP.

## Graph representation

```Cypher
(:AS {asn: 7494})-[:AVAILABLE {registry: 'apnic'}]->(:OpaqueID {id: 'apnic'})
(:AS {asn: 2497})-[:ASSIGNED {registry: 'apnic'}]->(:OpaqueID {id: 'A91A7381'})
(:AS {asn: 608})-[:RESERVED {registry: 'arin'}]->(:OpaqueID {id: 'arin'})
(:AS {asn: 2497})-[:COUNTRY]->(:Country {country_code: 'JP'})

(:Prefix {prefix: '2a03:1dc0::/27'})-[:AVAILABLE {registry: 'ripencc'}]->(:OpaqueID {id: 'ripencc'})
(:Prefix {prefix: '202.0.65.0/24'})-[:ASSIGNED {registry: 'apnic'}]->(:OpaqueID {id: 'A91A7381'})
(:Prefix {prefix: '196.20.32.0/19'})-[:RESERVED {registry: 'afrinic'}]->(:OpaqueID {id: 'afrinic'})
(:Prefix {prefix: '196.20.32.0/19'})-[:COUNTRY]->(:Country {country_code: 'ZZ'})
```

The report also contains `allocated` records that would result in a `ALLOCATED` relationship.
However, this crawler does not add ASes, so if the AS node was not created by another crawler, which
should not happen for `allocated` ASes, the relationship is not created.

The IPv4 address ranges in the report are not necessarily aligned with CIDR ranges (prefixes are
represented by the first IP and a *count of hosts*). The crawler decomposes these IP blocks into
valid CIDR prefixes if necessary.

## Dependence

This crawler does not create new AS nodes and should be run after crawlers that push many AS nodes
(e.g., `ripe.as_names`).
